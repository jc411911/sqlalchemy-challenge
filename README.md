### Climate Starter Project

#### Project Overview
This project consists of a Jupyter Notebook (`climate_starter.ipynb`) and a Flask application (`app.py`) that interact with a SQLite database containing climate data. The notebook is used for data analysis, while the Flask application provides an API to access the climate data.

#### File Descriptions
- `climate_starter.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook is used for exploring and analyzing the climate data stored in the SQLite database. It includes various data analysis tasks such as:
    - Loading the data from the SQLite database.
    - Performing data cleaning and transformation.
    - Generating summary statistics.
    - Visualizing the data using plots and charts.
    
- `app.py`: This is a Flask application that sets up a web server to provide API endpoints for accessing the climate data.
